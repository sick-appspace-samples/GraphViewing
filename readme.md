## GraphViewing
Visualizing graphs for math function, histogram and polar plot.

### Description
This sample shows three different graph viewing examples:
 - A mathematical function graph with overlay
 - A histogram
 - A polar plot

### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page.
To run this sample a device with SICK Algorithm API is necessary.
For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the
Emulator on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
